# PID Controller Tuning Projects in MATLAB

This repository contains three MATLAB-based projects focused on PID controller design and tuning using various approaches, including Ziegler-Nichols and Simulink simulation.

## ðŸ“‚ Project List

### ðŸ”¹ 1. Closed Loop Ziegler-Nichols
- Tuning PID parameters using closed-loop response.
- MATLAB script and Simulink model included.

### ðŸ”¹ 2. Open Loop Ziegler-Nichols
- Classic Z-N method using open-loop step response.
- Includes process reaction curve method.
- MATLAB simulation and graphs included.

### ðŸ”¹ 3. PID Tuning (Manual + Simulink)
- Tuning a PID controller using manual trial and error.
- Simulink-based closed-loop control system.

## ðŸ“¦ How to Use

1. Download and extract any `.zip` file.
2. Open the `.m` or `.slx` files in MATLAB.
3. Run the script or simulate the model to observe the system response.

## ðŸ“Œ Requirements

- MATLAB R2021a or later
- Simulink
- Control System Toolbox (recommended)
